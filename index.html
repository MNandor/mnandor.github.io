<h2 id="hi-im-nándor">Hi, I&rsquo;m Nándor.</h2>
<p>As an Android developer, I am passionate about creating engaging and user-friendly mobile apps that deliver a great experience for users. With the rapid growth and evolution of the Android platform, there are always new and exciting opportunities to explore, and I am constantly learning and growing as a developer to stay at the forefront of the industry.</p>
<p>Whether I am working on a new app from scratch, or optimizing and improving an existing app, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality apps that are reliable, performant, and user-friendly.</p>
<p>I am also an advocate of open-source software, and believe in the power of collaboration and community to drive innovation and progress in the tech industry. In my work as an Android developer, I strive to create apps that are useful, user-friendly, and adhere to the principles of open-source software.</p>

<h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>
<p>I like Linux because it blurs the line between the user and the developer. Are you a developer if you run a command you found online? Obviously not. Are you a developer if you pipe a couple commands into each other? Still probably not&hellip; What if you write your own bash functions or share your config files with others?</p>
<p>I use Arch btw.</p>
<h2 id="python">Python</h2>
<p>Python is my favorite programming language. I know that C is faster, but a lot of the time, development time is more valuable than runtime.</p>
<p>Tabs over spaces. Sue me.</p>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<p>I know just enough HTML/CSS to have made this website. I also know Javascript, but I don&rsquo;t feel the need to execute any code on this page.</p>
<p>I speak English, Hungarian, some Romanian, some German, and an ever-so-tiny amount of Japanese.</p>
<p>I enjoy hiking in nature, tinkering with computers, and learning languages.</p>
