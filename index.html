<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Nándor.</p>
<p>I like free and open source software.</p>
<h2 id="android">Android</h2>
<p>I currently work as an Android developer in Java and Kotlin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working in Agile teams and got to work on applications connecting to IoT devices.</p>
<h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>
<p>I like Linux because it blurs the line between the user and the developer. Are you a developer if you run a command you found online? Obviously not. Are you a developer if you pipe a couple commands into each other? Still probably not&hellip; What if you write your own bash functions or share your config files with others?</p>
<p>I use Arch btw.</p>
<h2 id="python">Python</h2>
<p>Python is my favorite programming language. I know that C is faster, but a lot of the time, development time is more valuable than runtime.</p>
<p>Tabs over spaces. Sue me.</p>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<p>I know just enough HTML/CSS to have made this website. I also know Javascript, but I don&rsquo;t feel the need to execute any code on this page.</p>
<p>I speak English, Hungarian, some Romanian, some German, and an ever-so-tiny amount of Japanese.</p>
