<h2 id="hi-im-nándor">Hi, I&rsquo;m Nándor.</h2>
<p>As an Android developer, I am passionate about creating engaging and user-friendly mobile apps that deliver a great experience for users. With the rapid growth and evolution of the Android platform, there are always new and exciting opportunities to explore, and I am constantly learning and growing as a developer to stay at the forefront of the industry.</p>
<p>Whether I am working on a new app from scratch, or optimizing and improving an existing app, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality apps that are reliable, performant, and user-friendly.</p>
<p>I am also an advocate of open-source software, and believe in the power of collaboration and community to drive innovation and progress in the tech industry. In my work as an Android developer, I strive to create apps that are useful, user-friendly, and adhere to the principles of open-source software.</p>
<p>I also happily use custom ROMs. Currently on LineageOS, but I&rsquo;m planning to explore GrapheneOS and /e/OS soon.</p>

<h1 id="more-about-me">More About Me</h1>
<h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m a full-time Linux user (Arch btw) and I also maintain my home server using Fedora. I started with Ubuntu in 2019 and settled on Arch soon after.
I like to tinker with my system when I have the time, and many of my scripts and config files can be found on my GitHub.</p>
<p>My desktop consists of Qtile as my Window Manager, Vim as my text editor, Firefox as my browser, and Bash as my shell.</p>
<h2 id="python">Python</h2>
<p>Though I work in Android, I enjoy using Python for all kinds of desktop-based scripting tasks. The vast array of libraries and convenience of coding Python provides is just invaluable.</p>
<p>Many of my projects, including my BSc thesis were written in Python.</p>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<p>I know just enough HTML/CSS to have made this website. I have some experience with Javascript - my Anki card templates were written with it.</p>
<p>I use Markdown for note-taking, or LaTeX for serious publications.</p>
<p>I think that Git is still underappreciated despite its popularity. There is some real magic there, once you learn more than the two or three most common commands.</p>
<h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
<p>I enjoy learning languages! I speak English, Hungarian, some Romanian, some German, and an ever-so-tiny amount of Japanese. I have a few others in mind for the future, too.</p>
<p>I recently got back into playing Chess.</p>
<p>Hiking. I love hiking.</p>
