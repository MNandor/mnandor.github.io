		<p>There can be many good reasons to create a website.
It can act as a professional portfolio, inform visitors about an event, host a comic series, or any of the other endless possibilities.</p>
<p>Though much of the modern web is bloated with tracking and cookie popups, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way.
There is still a place for simple, functional websites.</p>
<p>This blog post will detail how I created <a href="https://nandor.ml">my own website</a>.
The best part about it?
It&rsquo;s completely free!</p>
<h1 id="static-site---hugo">Static Site - Hugo</h1>
<p>A static website is essentially a website that&rsquo;s readable.
It doesn&rsquo;t require a login, doesn&rsquo;t manage a database, and serves the same content rather than dynamically adjusting it to the visitor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simpler.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an even simpler alternative to what I&rsquo;m presenting here called <a href="http://geminiquickst.art/">Gemini</a>, but for now let&rsquo;s go with the widespread World Wide Web variant.
Say that three times in a row.</p>
<h2 id="hugo">Hugo</h2>
<p>Hugo is a static site generator.
Once set up, it converts source files in the easily-writable Markdown format into HTML pages.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFL09qhKi5I">Luke Smith&rsquo;s Guide</a> on Hugo is extremely helpful for a beginner.
My own website&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/MNandor/hugo-website">source</a> is also written in the Hugo framework.</p>
<p>After running the <code>hugo new site</code> command and configuring the website either following a tutorial or the <a href="https://gohugo.io/documentation/">docs</a>, running <code>hugo</code> will generate a static HTML website in the <code>public</code> subdirectory. We can simply host this directory on the web.</p>
<p>Pro tip: <code>hugo serve --noHTTPCache</code> is great for development as it automatically refreshes the website as it&rsquo;s being edited.
I&rsquo;m running this right now as I&rsquo;m writing this!</p>
<h1 id="hosting">Hosting</h1>
<p>Hosting a website will always cost some money, whether it&rsquo;s a <abbr title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</abbr> or electricity.
Luckily, there are some services that offer hosting of static sites for free.
<a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is one such host. Those trying to get away from Microsoft might also try <a href="https://srht.site/">SourceHut</a>.</p>
<h1 id="domain">Domain</h1>
<p>A domain name is what lets the user visit a web address rather than an IP address.
GitHub pages allows for custom domain addresses to be linked to our static site.</p>
<p>A great way to get free domains is <a href="https://freenom.com">Freenom</a> where <code>.tk</code> and <code>.ml</code> domains can be rented and renewed for free.</p>
