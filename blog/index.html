			<p>Food If you&rsquo;re not particularly good at cooking, or won&rsquo;t have much time to do so, get yourself a slow cooker. Put a small cup filled with water in the microwave when reheating pizza or pasta. Using an electric kettle will always be more efficient than a stove. Rice is cheap and filling. Peanuts have lots of protein. Financial Make a bank account as soon as you legally can. Be the sole owner of it.</p>

			</h2>
			<p>In my last blog post, I described the installation process of my new phone. I am extremely happy with both the device and LineageOS.
However, LineageOS only ships a few bare essential apps, such as Calendar or Clock. They do not have many features either.
This is a good thing. I intentionally chose a non-bloated ROM so that I can configure it to my liking.
In this post, I&rsquo;ll detail all the choice I made in terms of apps to install.</p>

			</h2>
			<p>I try to not rely on my phone too much. I don&rsquo;t think everything should be an app, and I&rsquo;d rather not have daddy Google track every step I take. There&rsquo;s some irony to it - Android development is literally my profession - but maybe that&rsquo;s exactly why I try to separate work from personal use.
As a Linux user, I&rsquo;m used to a customizable system made of open-source components. Android is definitely better than its main competitor, iOS in this regard.</p>

Was Ich Will Um den Kontext zu verdeutlichen: Hier geht es um die Sicherung von Dateien unter Arch Linux.
Mein Laptop hat eine 2TB SSD (wovon 1TB wichtig ist).
Ich habe auch eine externe Festplatte mit 1 TB, die ich f√ºr Sicherungskopien verwenden m√∂chte.
Die 3-2-1-Regel Es gibt einen beliebten Ratschlag, wenn es um Dateisicherungen geht:</p>

			</h2>
			<p>Introduction Programming (also known as coding or development) can be a creative hobby, a lucrative career, or both.
The main skill required for a programmer is problem solving. &ldquo;I want to achieve X, what can I do to achieve X?&rdquo;
It&rsquo;s also important to be adaptable, open to learning new things. The field is ever-evolving, and there&rsquo;s always something new to learn.
Finally, if you don&rsquo;t intend to work on solo projects, efficient communication with teammates is crucial.</p>

			</h2>
			<p>Skyrim Skyrim is a medieval fantasy RPG set in the world of Elder Scrolls. The planet is called Nirn, the continent Tamriel, and the country, well, Skyrim.
The player can freely explore the open world right after the tutorial area. She&rsquo;s encouraged to fight bandits, save people, learn magic, kill dragons, ride dragons, and influence the political landscape.
Skyrim is widely praised for how much it lets the player customize her Dragonborn, be it a Nord fighter wielding a greatsword, the oh-so-prevalent stealth archer Khajiit, or a mage who challenges herself by using anything but the Destruction school.</p>

				<a href="/blog/custom-keyboard-layouts/">Custom Keyboard Layouts</a>
			</h2>
			<p>If you&rsquo;re using a PC or laptop keyboard, there&rsquo;s a good chance it comes with the EN (US) keyboard layout. That&rsquo;s the letters of the English alphabet, along with special symbols like ;:'&quot;[](). This is a great layout for general use as well as programming.
What this layout lacks is the special letters non-English languages use. Hungarian uses √≥√∂≈ë√∫√º≈±√≠, German √∂√º√§√ü, and Romanian √ÆƒÉ√¢»ô»õ, along with their capitalized versions.
To type these letters, the typical solution is to change the keyboard layout to the language&rsquo;s.</p>

			</h2>
			<p>There can be many good reasons to create a website. It can act as a professional portfolio, inform visitors about an event, host a comic series, or any of the other endless possibilities.
Though much of the modern web is bloated with tracking and cookie popups, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way. There is still a place for simple, functional websites.
This blog post will detail how I created my own website.</p>
