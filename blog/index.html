			<p>Introduction Programming (also known as coding or development) can be a creative hobby, a lucrative career, or both.
The main skill required for a programmer is problem solving. &ldquo;I want to achieve X, what can I do to achieve X?&rdquo;
It&rsquo;s also important to be adaptable, open to learning new things. The field is ever-evolving, and there&rsquo;s always something new to learn.
Finally, if you don&rsquo;t intend to work on solo projects, efficient communication with teammates is crucial.</p>

			<p>Skyrim Skyrim is a medieval fantasy RPG set in the world of Elder Scrolls. The planet is called Nirn, the continent Tamriel, and the country, well, Skyrim.
The player can freely explore the open world right after the tutorial area. She&rsquo;s encouraged to fight bandits, save people, learn magic, kill dragons, ride dragons, and influence the political landscape.
Skyrim is widely praised for how much it lets the player customize her Dragonborn, be it a Nord fighter wielding a greatsword, the oh-so-prevalent stealth archer Khajiit, or a mage who challenges herself by using anything but the Destruction school.</p>

			<p>If you&rsquo;re using a PC or laptop keyboard, there&rsquo;s a good chance it comes with the EN (US) keyboard layout. That&rsquo;s the letters of the English alphabet, along with special symbols like ;:'&quot;[](). This is a great layout for general use as well as programming.
What this layout lacks is the special letters non-English languages use. Hungarian uses óöőúüűí, German öüäß, and Romanian îăâșț, along with their capitalized versions.
To type these letters, the typical solution is to change the keyboard layout to the language&rsquo;s.</p>
