		<p>In my <a href="../my-perfect-phone">last blog post</a>, I described the installation process of my new phone.
I am extremely happy with both the device and LineageOS.</p>
<p>However, LineageOS only ships a few bare essential apps, such as Calendar or Clock.
They do not have many features either.</p>
<p>This is a good thing.
I intentionally chose a non-bloated ROM so that I can configure it to my liking.</p>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll detail all the choice I made in terms of apps to install.
I&rsquo;ll be mainly talking about apps that replace what&rsquo;d come pre-installed on a traditional Android phone, since whether or not the user also needs Snapstagram is up to their preference.</p>
<p>Every app that links to F-Droid is open-source.
Just the nature of the platform.
In a few cases, I had to get the app from the Google Play Store, GitHub releases, or compile from source.
I&rsquo;ll mention when this is the case.</p>
<h1 id="system">System</h1>
<h2 id="terminal-emulator---termuxhttpsf-droidorgpackagescomtermux">Terminal Emulator - <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/">Termux</a></h2>
<p>As much as I don&rsquo;t like to use the term &ldquo;must-have&rdquo;, Termux is definitely an essential tool for anyone looking to do advanced work with their phone.
It&rsquo;s a full-fledged Linux terminal on your phone.
Termux has its own package manager and repositories.
It lets me use my favorite Linux tools such as Vim or Taskwarrior.
I could also use my phone as a home server.</p>
<p>If I could only ever use one app, it&rsquo;d be Termux, so I had to put it first in the list.</p>
<h2 id="file-syncing---syncthinghttpsf-droidorgenpackagescomnutomicsyncthingandroid">File Syncing - <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid/">Syncthing</a></h2>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even to begin to explain how useful Syncthing is.
It&rsquo;s cloud storage without a cloud.
It&rsquo;s end-to-end encrypted real-time file syncing.</p>
<p>It runs in the background and it&rsquo;s an essential component of my workflow.
Camera folder immediately shared with my computer.
My music library updated whenever I make a change.
Files and documents, Taskwarrior data, all shared across devices.</p>
<p>Syncthing is awesome.
Once you get it, you won&rsquo;t understand how you used to live without it.</p>
<h2 id="app-store---f-droidhttpsf-droidorg">App Store - <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a></h2>
<p>Pretty standard for de-Googled phones, F-Droid is full of open-source apps.</p>
<h2 id="app-store---aurora-launcherhttpsf-droidorgenpackagescomaurorastore">App Store - <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.aurora.store/">Aurora Launcher</a></h2>
<p>A nice little front-end to Google&rsquo;s Play Store.
Aurora allows for anonymous downloads for the occasional app that can&rsquo;t be found on F-Droid.</p>
<h2 id="keyboard---hackers-keyboardhttpsf-droidorgenpackagesorgpocketworkstationpckeyboard">Keyboard - <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.pocketworkstation.pckeyboard/">Hacker&rsquo;s Keyboard</a></h2>
<p>No longer actively developed, but still insanely useful.
I&rsquo;m more than happy to let go of modern features like swipe-typing or prediction in exchange for real arrow keys and PC-like symbol buttons.</p>
<h2 id="launcher---discreet-launcherhttpsf-droidorgenpackagescomvincent_falzondiscreetlauncher">Launcher - <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.vincent_falzon.discreetlauncher/">Discreet Launcher</a></h2>
<!-- todo screendhot -->
<p>I was mostly happy with Nova until now, but I decided to go with something open-source.
I tried out a few launchers.
I really liked the idea behind Last Launcher&rsquo;s word cloud.</p>
<p>In the end though, Discreet convinced me with its ability to not cover my wallpaper.
It also has great search functionality.
When I add apps to folders, they disappear from the main app drawer, which helps a lot with organization (a full list can still be searched through).</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/MNandor/discreet-launcher">forked</a> the Discreet Launcher repository for a grand total of one commit I wanted to reverse.
I wanted for the app search to work even if I don&rsquo;t start typing at the beginning of the app name.
For example, &ldquo;loc&rdquo; should be found in the app &ldquo;Clock&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="camera---open-camerahttpsf-droidorgenpackagesnetsourceforgeopencamera">Camera - <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.sourceforge.opencamera/">Open Camera</a></h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need my phone to apply all the latest AI enhancements to my photos.
I certainly don&rsquo;t want it to phone home to Google servers every time I take a picture.</p>
<p>Open Camera exposes all the configuration settings I could ever need.
I&rsquo;m extremely happy with it.</p>
<h2 id="browser---firefoxhttpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidorgmozillafirefox">Browser - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox">Firefox</a></h2>

<h2 id="music-player---vlchttpsf-droidorgenpackagesorgvideolanvlc">Music Player - <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.videolan.vlc/">VLC</a></h2>
<p>I put some actual effort into comparing music players.
I was actually reasonably happy with my former non-FOSS BlackPlayer.
I wanted something good to replace it.</p>
<p>Before I get into the comparison, I need to explain the structure of my music library.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have .mp3 files saved in one single folder, no subdirectories.</li>
<li>They use ID3 tags.</li>
<li>The artist field is set for all of them.</li>
<li>The album field is set for some of them.</li>
<li>The album art field is set for some of them, including some that do not have the album field set.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are a list of my requirements.
Notice that some of them I put there because I noticed that some of the apps were missing the feature.
I don&rsquo;t have &ldquo;can play music&rdquo; as a requirement, because <em>all</em> of them can, and it&rsquo;s not helpful for comparison.</p>

<p>Here are my results after trying out all these apps.

<p>VLC and Auxio both filled the Albums screen with a bunch of unlabeled albums.
For example, if I had a .mp3 file tagged with &ldquo;Rick Astley&rdquo; as an artist, but not tagged by any album, then Auxio would display a 1-song album with its name being the name of the folder I keep the music on.
VLC would do the same, except label it as Unknown Albums.
Both would display one of these albums for each unique artist.</p>
<p>However, they met every other expectation.
What set VLC apart is displaying the correct art even for the songs that didn&rsquo;t belong to any album.
This was a feature that was missing even in BlackPlayer, so I decided to go with VLC.</p>

<h2 id="file-manager---amazehttpsf-droidorgenpackagescomamazefilemanager">File Manager - <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.amaze.filemanager/">Amaze</a></h2>
<p>A great file manager with multi-select, root mode, shortcuts to folders, and two tabs to move between.</p>
<h2 id="gallery---simple-gallery-prohttpsf-droidorgenpackagescomsimplemobiletoolsgallerypro">Gallery - <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro/">Simple Gallery Pro</a></h2>
<p>The team behind these &ldquo;simple&rdquo; apps does a great job at offering a coherent, non-bloated set of applications.
For my gallery app, I decided to go with what they offer.</p>
<h2 id="youtube-client---newpipehttpsf-droidorgenpackagesorgschabinewpipe">Youtube Client - <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/">NewPipe</a></h2>
<p>Though a Google product, I can&rsquo;t deny that YouTube is useful.
Obviously I&rsquo;m not going to use the first-party app, so my options are NewPipe or some fork of Vanced.
I&rsquo;ve always been on Team NewPipe.</p>
<!-- todo optional apps -->
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>For things I didn&rsquo;t mention, such as Calendar, Clock, or Calculator (and anything else that doesn&rsquo;t start with a C), I just went with the default option.
Overall, I&rsquo;m pretty happy with my new setup.</p>
