		<h1 id="skyrim">Skyrim</h1>
<p>Skyrim is a medieval fantasy RPG set in the world of Elder Scrolls. The planet is called Nirn, the continent Tamriel, and the country, well, Skyrim.</p>
<p>The player can freely explore the open world right after the tutorial area. She&rsquo;s encouraged to fight bandits, save people, learn magic, kill dragons, ride dragons, and influence the political landscape.</p>
<p>Skyrim is widely praised for how much it lets the player customize her Dragonborn, be it a Nord fighter wielding a greatsword, the oh-so-prevalent stealth archer Khajiit, or a mage who challenges herself by using anything but the Destruction school.</p>
<p>The best part about Skyrim is the fact that it has a hero. That&rsquo;s you. You are the hero. You have the freedom to go anywhere, the freedom to help or kill nearly anybody, and the only limitation is your own character&rsquo;s abilities. Your achievements will be recognized, your contributions felt, and your friendship rewarded.</p>
<p>Did you know, that the song that soundtrack that plays during dragon encounters is called &ldquo;One They Fear&rdquo;? That&rsquo;s referring to <em>you</em>, the Dragonborn. It&rsquo;s not the boss music of dragons for you to listen to. It&rsquo;s <em>your</em> boss music.</p>
<p>Contrast this with real life, where you seem to hit hard walls way more often than you&rsquo;d like to, where a bed to sleep is not a nice thing to find but rather a need, where some people will dislike you just because.</p>
<p>The typical gamer will be more introverted than average. The typical introvert will be less confident than average. Isn&rsquo;t it good that these people can live in a world where they are the hero? Don&rsquo;t they deserve to feel like they can achieve anything they want, too?</p>
<p>I used the phrasing &ldquo;contrast this with real life&rdquo;. Doesn&rsquo;t real life work the same way? Is there anything physically preventing you from going on an adventure?</p>
<p>Maybe I only feel like there isn&rsquo;t because I&rsquo;m more confident. I did play Skyrim after all.</p>
<h1 id="doom-2016">Doom 2016</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>They are rage.<br>
Brutal, without mercy.<br>
But you, you will be worse.<br>
Rip and tear until it is done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The intro quote does a surprisingly good job describing what Doom is. The enemy is vicious, dangerous. And <em>they</em> are the ones who need to run from <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>Doom 2016 technically has a story! And those who appreciate the lore might even dig into it. But the game doesn&rsquo;t try to push it too hard. It&rsquo;s made very clear, that the selling point is the mindless killing along with the power fantasy of pulling off various weapon-switch combo moves as the player dishes out death to a horde of demons.</p>
<p>Some games are designed to make the player feel like he&rsquo;s overcoming challenges. Doomguy though, he&rsquo;s just a butcher in a slaughterhouse.</p>
<p>Something something, violent games, violent tendencies? Nah. Being born causes violent tendencies. If anything, violent games are a great way to let out the steam without causing real damage.</p>
